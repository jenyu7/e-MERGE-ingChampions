***HW #07: What Does the Data Say?***
**Plan:** Find the runtime of MergeSort on four arrays of different sizes, and graph the trend by graphs of n, n^2 and nlogn to see which best fits. <br> 
**Method:**
  1. Create 4 arrays of size 1, 10, 100, and 1000. 
  2. Create a 2D Array holding these 4 arrays. 
  3. Run through these four arrays via the 2D array, and populate them with random numbers. 
  4. Sort each one of these arrays using MergeSort, and store the runtimes of the sorting into a string. 
  5. Print the string at the end, and graph the times.
